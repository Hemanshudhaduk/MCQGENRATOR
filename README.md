MCQ Generator is a Streamlit-based AI application that creates multiple-choice questions from PDF or text files using LLMs. Users can upload content, choose difficulty levels, and download the generated MCQs as a PDF. The app uses LangChain, PyPDF2, and ReportLab for text processing and PDF generation. It is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and powered by Groq/OpenAI APIs. To run locally, install dependencies from requirements.txt, set your API key in a .env file, and start the app with streamlit run MCQ_GENRATOR.py.
